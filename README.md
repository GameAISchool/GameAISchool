# Artificial Intelligence and Games
## Game AI Jam hub

The [International Summer School on Artificial Intelligence and Games](https://school.gameaibook.org/) is the leading global event dedicated to the intersection of AI and games. This summer school provides an intensive learning experience covering cutting-edge AI techniques in game playing, content generation, and player modeling delivered by leading experts from the games industry. This summer school offers an unparalleled deep dive into AI and Machine Learning for games. 

A big (and fun!) part of the Summer School is the Game AI Jam, facilitated by [Antonios Liapis](https://antoniosliapis.com). Every year since 2018, we've been running the Game AI Jam to close off the event, allowing attendees to put their knowledge into action by collaborating on creative AI-driven game projects in an exciting challenge. Every year, the winner is judged by the jammers alone through the Best By Popular Vote award. All jam games are publically available on GitHub to inspire the next cohort of jammers!

We record the Jams since 2018 below, along with the winner of every year:
